# SMTP-POP3-MailServer-MailClient

The goal of this assignment is to learn how to use SMTP and POP3 to send and receive emails from a remote host. We will use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and build a simple mail server and client to send and receive mails. 

SMTP is used to send mails from a mail client to the mail server, while POP3 is used to access mail from a mail server via an email client.

A TCP connection is established between two SMTP servers to transmit and receive emails.
As with SMTP, POP3 uses text commands over a TCP connection.
